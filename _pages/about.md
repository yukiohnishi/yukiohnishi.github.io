I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Jordan Awan](https://jordan-awan.com/) and [Prof. Arman Sabbaghi](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~sabbaghi/). My research interests lie in the broad areas of causal inference, Bayesian analysis, and differential privacy.
Before joining Purdue, I worked as a data scientist at [Visional, inc.](https://www.visional.inc/en/visional-way.html), where I developed recommendation systems and introduced novel statistical methods for the efficient digital marketing. Additionally, I interned as a data scientist at [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/) in the summer of 2023.
