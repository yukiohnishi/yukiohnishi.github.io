I am a postdoctoral associate at the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), where I have the privilege of working with Professor Fan Li. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University, where I was co-advised by Professors Jordan Awan and Arman Sabbaghi. My research focuses on developing theory and methods for causal inference under complex data structures, with an emphasis on Bayesian nonparametric methodology. I am particularly interested in post-treatment confounding, mediation analysis, interference and spillovers, sequential treatments, time-to-event outcomes, and complex randomized experiments, including cluster-randomized and two-stage trials. During my Ph.D., I also worked on differential privacy, especially its interface with causal inference and the privacyâ€“utility trade-offs in statistical modeling.
