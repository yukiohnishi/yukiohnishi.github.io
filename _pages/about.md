I am a postdoctoral associate at the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), where I have the privilege of working with Professor Fan Li and many talented collegues. My research aims to develop theory and methods for causal inference under complex data structure, with an emphasis on Bayesian methodologies. Main interests include post-treatment confounding, mediation analysis, interference and spillovers, sequential treatments, time-to-event outcomes, and complicated randomized experiments such as cluster-randomized trials and two-stage trials. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University, where I was co-advised by Professors Jordan Awan and Arman Sabbaghi. During my Ph.D., I also worked on differential privacy, particularly its interface with causal inference and the privacy-utility trade-offs in statistical modeling.
