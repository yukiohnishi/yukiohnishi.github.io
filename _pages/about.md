I am a postdoctoral associate at the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), where I have the privilege of working with Professor Fan Li. My research develops theory and methods for causal inference under complex dependence, with an emphasis on Bayesian nonparametric approaches. Current interests include post-treatment confounding, mediation analysis, interference and spillovers, sequential treatments, time-to-event outcomes, and CRTs. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University, where I was co-advised by Professors Jordan Awan and Arman Sabbaghi. During my Ph.D., I also worked on differential privacy, particularly its interface with causal inference and the privacy-utility trade-offs in statistical modeling.
